# Moonriver Unified Subquery

This repo indexes Substrate and Ethereum data on the Moonriver network using Subquery. It's still a work in progress as there are a number of issues to resolve but the purpose is to build a unified block explorer.

I'm stucked because of this error `ERROR failed to index block at height 59845 handleEvent() TypeError: Cannot read property 'block' of undefined` ðŸ˜ž ðŸ˜¢

However, the frontend explorer is live on [heroku](https://moonriver-explorer.herokuapp.com/) and the source code is [here](https://github.com/bizzyvinci/moonriver-explorer) (also in progress).
